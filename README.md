# Hi, I'm Usama. 👋
### Automation Architect | AI Systems Integrator

I build production-ready AI agents and autonomous systems that connect LLMs to real-world business infrastructure.

## 🚀 Featured Project: AI Lead Qualification Engine
**Stack:** `n8n` • `OpenAI GPT-4o` • `PostgreSQL` • `Twilio` • `Airtable`

An autonomous SMS receptionist designed to qualify service leads in real-time. This system replaces manual intake by using a "Verification Loop" to ensure data accuracy before triggering business alerts.

#### Key Engineering Highlights:
* **Persistent Memory:** Implemented a PostgreSQL-backed session manager to maintain conversation context across asynchronous SMS exchanges.
* **Logic Branching:** Engineered a parallel execution path that separates clean customer-facing chat from internal system signals (`[[SUMMARY_COMPLETE]]`).
* **Automated Hand-off:** Real-time data synchronization with Airtable and instant high-priority email notifications for "Ready-to-Quote" leads.
